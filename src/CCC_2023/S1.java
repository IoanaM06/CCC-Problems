Problem Description
Bocchi the Builder just finished constructing her latest project: a laneway consisting of two
rows of white equilateral triangular tiles. However, at the last moment, disaster struck! She
accidentally spilled black paint on some of the tiles. Now, some of the tiles are wet and the
other tiles are dry. Bocchi must place warning tape around the perimeters of all wet areas.
Can you help her determine how many metres of tape she needs? The first triangular tile will
point upwards. Each pair of adjacent tiles (that is, tiles that share a common side) will point
in opposite directions. Each tile has a side length of 1 metre.

Input Specification
The first line of input will consist of one positive integer C, representing the number of
columns.
The next two lines will each consist of C integers separated by spaces. Each integer represents
the colour of a tile along the laneway, with 1 indicating that the tile is black (wet) and 0
indicating that the tile is white (dry).

The following table shows how the available 15 marks are distributed:
3 The laneway is not very long, black tiles are never adjacent and the second row is fully white.
C ≤ 2 000
3 The laneway is not very long, black tiles may be adjacent
and the second row is fully white.
C ≤ 2 000
5 The laneway is not very long, black tiles may be adjacent
and may appear in the second row.
C ≤ 2 000
4 The laneway may be very long, black tiles may be adjacent
and may appear in the second row.
C ≤ 200 000
